# [EPOCH 1.0.6.2] Bury and butcher bodies.
Bury and butcher bodies for epoch 1.0.6.2 by salival (https://github.com/oiad)

* Discussion URL: https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/43501-release-bury-and-butcher-body-for-1061/

* Tested as working on a blank Epoch 1.0.6.2 server
* Contains a server side scheduler module to clean up old weapon crates, graves and crosses after 25 minutes.
* Removes the flies sound when body is buried for performance.

# REPORTING ERRORS/PROBLEMS

1. Please, if you report issues can you please attach (on pastebin or similar) your CLIENT rpt log file as this helps find out the errors very quickly. To find this logfile:

	```sqf
	C:\users\<YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Arma 2 OA\ArmA2OA.RPT
	```

# Install:

* This install basically assumes you have NO custom variables.sqf or compiles.sqf or fn_selfActions.sqf, I would recommend diffmerging where possible.

# Mission folder install:

1. In mission\init.sqf find: <code>call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\variables.sqf";</code> and add directly below:

	```sqf
	call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "dayz_code\init\variables.sqf";
	```

2. In mission\init.sqf find: <code>call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\compiles.sqf";</code> and add directly below:

	```sqf
	call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "dayz_code\init\compiles.sqf";
	```

3. Download the <code>stringTable.xml</code> file linked below from the [Community Localization GitHub](https://github.com/oiad/communityLocalizations) and copy it to your mission folder, it is a community based localization file and contains translations for major community mods including this one.

# dayz_server install:

1. Overwrite the following files to your dayz_server folder preserving the directory structure:
	```sqf
	dayz_server\system\scheduler\sched_corpses.sqf
	dayz_server\system\scheduler\sched_init.sqf
	dayz_server\system\scheduler\sched_lootCrates.sqf
	```

# Battleye CreateVehicle.txt filter:

1. In your config\<yourServerName>\Battleye\createvehicle.txt around line 2 find: <code>5 !(^DZ_|^z_|^pz_|^WeaponHolder|Box|dog|PZombie_VB|^Smoke|^Chem|^._40mm|_DZ$|^Trap)</code> add this to the end of the line:

	```sqf
	!=GraveCross1
	```

	So it will then look like this for example:

	```sqf
	5 !(^DZ_|^z_|^pz_|^WeaponHolder|Box|dog|PZombie_VB|^Smoke|^Chem|^._40mm|_DZ$|^Trap) <CUT> !=GraveCross1
	```
